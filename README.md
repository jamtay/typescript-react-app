Simple frontend of contacts list using React and Typescript
This is based on https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-customer-list-management-app-with-react-and-typescript 


**To run**
- Run [this](https://github.com/jamtay/express-typescript-learning) on port 3000
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

**TODO:** 

- Refactor to smaller methods
- Remove hardcoded localhost:3000 (add env file)
- Add search endpoint to talk to search-api search endpoint
- private vs public in TS?
